# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is software designing,developing,testing,deploying and maintainace.
creation of softwares application that powers medern life in aspect like communication.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programing languages.
Structured programing.
Rise of agile methologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements. involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design involves creating hih level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer;Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer;Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
project manager;Overseas the planning execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing of requirements during the development cycle thus proper research must be done.
Tight deadlines this may be due to pressure to deliver software products on schedule which can result in rushed development and compromised quality thus provision of enough time.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit;involves testing individuals components
Intergration;involves testing interactions between different components.
System;involve testing the entire software system
Acceptance;invones testing the software against user requiremens

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
is all about crafting questions to get the best possible responnses from AI models.
it help in avoiding mistakes

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
